# Engineering log

A running record of problems hit while building this, how they were diagnosed,
and what was done about them. Entries are append-only and in the order they
were encountered.

The point of this file is that every non-obvious line of code in the repo
should be traceable to a reason recorded here.

---

## #1 — `AttachRolePolicy` fails for AWS-managed policies under moto

**Symptom.** Seeding IAM threw `NoSuchEntityException: Policy
arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AdministratorAccess does not exist or is not
attachable.`

**Diagnosis.** Attaching an AWS-managed policy requires that policy to exist in
the mock. moto ships the managed policy catalogue but does not load it by
default, because parsing several hundred policy documents on boot is slow.

**Fix.** `MOTO_IAM_LOAD_MANAGED_POLICIES=true` in the moto service environment
(`docker-compose.yml`).

**Why it matters.** Without it, the entire "which roles have admin access"
scenario is unbuildable — `AdministratorAccess` is the canonical way that
privilege is granted, and we need the real document to evaluate it rather than
pattern-matching the policy name.

## #2 — Resources silently vanishing into a second AWS account

**Symptom.** After assuming a role and creating an IAM role, `CreateFunction`
failed with `AccessDeniedException` claiming the execution role did not exist —
even though the previous call had just created it successfully.

**Diagnosis.** moto namespaces every resource by the **account id carried in
the credentials**. The probe assumed `arn:aws:iam::000000000000:role/...`, so
the assumed-role session wrote into account `000000000000`, while moto's
default account — and the Lambda role ARN being referenced — was
`123456789012`. Two disjoint universes, no error until something tried to join
them.

**Fix.** Pin `MOTO_ACCOUNT_ID` in compose and require
`AWS_TARGET_ROLE_ARN` to name the same account. The seeder uses static
credentials (the "customer's administrator") while the scanner assumes the role
(dave.io arriving later), and both therefore land in one account.

**Why it matters.** This failure mode is silent — writes succeed, reads return
empty. Anyone pointing this project at a differently-numbered mock account
would see an empty graph and no error. It is called out in `.env.example` and
in the compose comments for that reason.

## #3 — moto does not simulate pagination

**Symptom.** A probe created 30 EC2 instances and iterated
`paginateDescribeInstances({ pageSize: 5 })`. It returned **one** page of 30.

**Diagnosis.** moto honours `MaxResults` inconsistently and mostly returns
whole collections in a single response. There is no `NextToken` to follow.

**Consequence.** Pagination correctness **cannot be demonstrated against the
mock**. Since "do you handle pagination?" is explicitly part of how this
assignment is judged, absence of evidence here is a real gap.

**Fix.** Pagination is exercised by unit tests against a stub client that does
return `NextToken`, rather than against moto. The production code always uses
the SDK paginators; the tests prove the loop terminates, accumulates every
page, and propagates errors mid-iteration.

## #4 — AWS Resource Explorer is not available in the mock

**Symptom.** `resource-explorer-2` calls against moto return an HTML 404 page,
surfacing as a JSON deserialisation error.

**Diagnosis.** moto has no `resource-explorer-2` backend.

**Consequence.** The README suggests Resource Explorer as a way to pull a bulk
inventory in a few calls, and it genuinely is the right first choice on a large
real account. It cannot be exercised here.

**Fix.** Implemented as an *optional fast path*: the scanner calls
`ListIndexes`, and only if an aggregator index exists does it use `Search` for
bulk discovery. Otherwise it falls back to per-service enumeration. The
fallback is the path that is tested and demonstrated; the fast path is written,
guarded, and documented as unverified against a real account.

There is a second, non-mock reason this has to be optional: Resource Explorer
requires an index to be created **in the customer account**, and a read-only
role cannot create one. On a real customer that has not enabled it, the fast
path is unavailable no matter what we do.

---

## #5 — `InstanceType` is an enum, not a string

**Symptom.** `tsc` rejected `InstanceType: extra.instanceType ?? "t3.medium"`
with `Type 'string' is not assignable to type '_InstanceType | undefined'`.

**Diagnosis.** A string *literal* in an object passed directly to a command is
contextually typed and narrows fine. Routing it through an optional parameter
typed `string` widens it, and the union no longer accepts it.

**Fix.** Typed the helper's parameter as the SDK's own `_InstanceType`.

**Why it is worth recording.** This is the ergonomic tax of AWS SDK v3's
generated enums, and it recurs. The habit that avoids it: take types *from the
SDK* rather than restating them as `string`.

---

## #6 — The SDK paginator refuses a hand-rolled fake client

**Symptom.** The pagination tests promised in #3 failed with
`Invalid client, expected instance of EC2Client`, from inside
`@smithy/core`'s `paginateOperation`.

**Diagnosis.** The generated paginators do a real `instanceof` check on the
client. A structurally-compatible object with a `send` method is rejected, so
the obvious way to write this test does not work.

**Fix.** Construct a genuine `EC2Client` and replace only its `send` method.

**Why the result is better than what was intended.** The original stub faked
the whole client. This version keeps command construction, input
serialisation and token threading real, and fakes only the wire — so the test
exercises considerably more of the path the collectors actually take.

A second, smaller trap on the way: `EC2Client` had been imported as
`import type`, which erases at run time. It has to be a value import to be
constructed.
